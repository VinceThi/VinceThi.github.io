## About Me

I study how high-dimensional complex systems can exhibit surprisingly low-dimensional behavior, using tools ranging from spectral graph theory, nonlinear dynamics, Koopman theory, and Lie symmetries.  
My work combines mathematical modeling and numerical simulation to understand various collective phenomena in complex systems.
